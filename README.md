# Recommender System

This project is based on the "OTTO â€“ Multi-Objective Recommender System" Challenge from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system).

In this project, I have built a recommender system using deep learning techniques such as LSTM and GRU to recommend the next best items to the user in an e-commerce system in real time. This recommender system analyzes user the past behavior and preferences, to provide personalized suggestions for the next best items to enhance the user's shopping experience. Through the seamless integration of deep learning, my project aims to enhance user engagement and boost sales within the e-commerce ecosystem.
