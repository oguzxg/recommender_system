# Recommender System

This project is based on the "OTTO â€“ Multi-Objective Recommender System" Challenge from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system).
In this project I build a recommender system using deep learning techniques such as LSTM and GRU to recommend the next best items to the user.
